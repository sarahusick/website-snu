<p> This page is devoted to all things in the province of Ontario, specifically Toronto, specifically the East Danforth region where I currently live. We moved to East Lynn in September 2020 and have been delighted with all the treasures this neighbourhood has to offer. Of course limited by the pandemic how much we could explore the new neighbourhood, we were still able to discover and enjoy much, and look foward to fully experiencing it once the pandemic is over. <br>Updated: 2021-03-20</p>

Wildlife list spotted in east danforth/creek area <br>
- rat x2

A surprising and perpetually intriguing plant grows in Small's Creek, above the moving water, remaining leafy (but subdued) all winter. Now that spring has come, it's burst full force. In the past week, we passed some people wading in rubber boots with pails chopping the leaves. Curious, ABN and I asked what IS the plant, and what is it for? The residents weren't eager to talk, and english not first language. Responded it was for soup. But over the next couple days, large tracks were trimmed. First, I wish I knew what this supposedly edible aquatic plant is. Second, I wondered if it was a thrify Asian knowledge of greens and harvesting a little for themself, no problem, though I wouldn't harvest it even though the creek is seemingly spring water (it never changes speed or volume, all season is trickling cheerfully, and always suprememly clear, so it doesn't seem street runoff, but still I wouldn't eat greens in a park in the middle of toronto. Then I wondered if, since they were coming back for such large quantities, that must be a LOT of soup they're making or ... selling at a small market? Harvesting off of public land for profit is a very specific crime in canada (has to do with conservation) but I'm not about to pounce on anyone. It's an incredibly abundant and resiliant plant, whatever it is. I do not know if the clusters of yellow flowers are of the same plant. In one of the early frosts this spring it did purple the leaves just a bit the next day, but boy did it spring back with a vengence. The creek, and the neighbourhood, and all of Toronto is bursting with tulips and daffoldils and little violets.. 3 weeks ago it was crocuses. We're much ahead of Manitoba, the climate I'm used to.

A juvenile mourning dove visited our backyard this morning. Sunbasked and explored peacefully before hopping off.

March 22 '21 Found a rock in apartment plant pot, from dirt from the Smalls Ravine. Shaped like an arrowhead, and if you put your fingers you can feel two grooves. Scraped lines on one side. 
Found a conspicuously shaped rock, possibly an artifact, on a bruce hike.<br>

A very yellow house. <br>

Smalls Creek . <br>
Goal: Try everything on the Danforth radiating from my location outward. <br>

Toronto QUESTS  <br>

- Mean Girls : U of T : got pictures <br>
- TO DO : look for the MEan Grils Mall and get pictures<br>
				 
<h2>Danforth Review</h2>	  
	<!--* - Google account for wrote reviews: martamo0012@gmail.com-->
	<!-- I would like to some how display this infomraiton with a map to see all the places I have visited, and need to visit --> 
	MAy 05, 2021 Square Boy - classic diner, no frills, the real deal, American and Greek basic grill (flame). Not really vegetarian friendly. Prepare for classic food.
	
Rocket Coffee , Danforth, 2021/05/04 Walking buy and the window sucked me in, bought 3 types of scones and they were fresh, and utterly phenomenal. Coffee -- perfect. Staff are lovely. 6 out of 5 stars. 

- I ralize my reviews sound kind of generic and fake, so neat to add more detail for next ones.  I'm writing google reviews for the first time, because I really want to support some local businesses in my new community, and this is an easy way to do it.  Only writing postive reviews for really local businesses, not to complain about somthing corporate who cares. <br><br>

Yanahi Sushi 03/03/21 Takeout : bluefin tuna, tempura, yasai roll, rainbow rolls. Quite good! the tuna was a bit fishy but very enjoyable. The yasai rolls had a different flavour, Abn even liked! Due to a pickled radish I beleive. 9/10 . 4 things were $47 so that's moderate. <br><br>

*11-23-20 Bare market 1480 Danforht ave 5/5 - "A fantastic gem!  Bulk foods, supplies (like shampoo) and nifty artisan-made products to help live with less waste."  Have added safety measures so can continue opporating in the pandemic.  Very hipster, but if you have the $$ to have nice/ethical things in your life, this is the place.  It's not that much more expensive, in fact for lots of things compareable.  Truly love this place. <br><br>

Value Village - not the largest VV in town, but it's robust and has everything you might need, stocked well.
<br><br>
Chinese dep plants window - great place for toilet paper and quick additions that you forgot. 
<br><br>
*11-23-20 Royal Beef 1968 Danforth - "Fantastic one-stop shop for Canadian and local meats, fish, cheese, buns, preserves and more.  We buy all our meat here now.  "
we buy all our meat products, fish and sometimes buns/bread from Royal Beef.  Excellent selection, and all Ontario or at least Canadian.  
<br><br>
Nov - Lifelabs medical - the staff were very good, and fairly accomodating. 
<br><br>
Nov 23 Valu Mart - everything you need for regular shopping, esp (white people) shopping, not the best middle eastern/asian selection, but very good.  Supplement with the Chinese deps for produce and Royal Beef for meat and buns. 
<br><br>
11-22-20 Book City > Fanastic selection, I try to support as much as I can.  Awesome that they're doing deliveries.  
<br><br>
Oct 20 Thai Room 5/5-  2063 Danforth Ave > super, great variety, and decilious, satisfies your cravings. Great for takeout for a crowd.  Big quanties, love their food.   Their online ordering system for takeout works really well.
<br><br>
*11-23-20 Danforth-Greenwood Medical clinic/pharmacy  "Virtual appointments smooth and fast. Every doctor I've had at this clinic has been pleasant, thorough and listened to my concerns."  The pharmacy is a bit sketch: asked to have shopper's as my pharmacy (closer, conveinient) but the gardasil was sold at their pharmacy... the pharacist wasn't wearing a mask, with the second worker, not wearing a mask, and talked to me for a LOOOng time about government regulations and covering medications, and had 2 sketchy weird phone calls with someone behind the counter while i was waiting for my vaccine. sort of weird.  But then again, it's my white suburban mindset that trusts an informal impersonal coprorate place like shoppers' and mistrusts the very personal service, which was admittantly very good. 
<br><br>
*11-23-20 Lucy Ethopian 1690 Danforth 5/5 star "Vegetarian platter extremely delicious, everything distinct, light, tasty, colourful, wow."  cheap. A bit disgruntled that they are letting ppeople with "medical excuses" not to wear a mask, which I think is an excuse for those who don't want to, besides those who ACtually can't wear a mask. but whatever. 
<br><br>
08-31-20 nearest chinese dep to danforth greenwood clinic on n. side > small, a bit expensive and eggplants were wrapped.
<br><br>
08-31-20 Next chinese dep on danforth on n. side : quite good, better selection, not super clean or bright.

Hart House - the workout rooms in these historical rooms, interesting, quite closed in and intimate, had a pass, very expensive. Too afraid to ask staff for help, was always nervous, but very glad it was often empty in the afternoons, or 102 other individuals.<br>
- the plays are awesome! Pre Covid, outstanding productions and talent! RHPS, Legally Blonde, and experimental theatre. We had season tickets. <br>
Textile Museum<em> Feb 23 '20  w/ Assaf Morgan: Fantastic! So much to see and learn. Excellent, thought provoking and visually delightful exhibtions. Wish there was more you could touch.</em> <br><br>

<h3>PLACES TO GO</h3>
- Allen Gardens - probably my favorite place in Toronto<br>
- Casa Loma - quite alight. <br>
- CN tower - overrated, but you can contemplate when you get there, watch the tourists stomp on the glass floor<br>
- Ripley's Aquarium - delightful, full afternoon of sight seeing, fantastic displays<br><br>
                
Ontario<br>
- I love guelph, so interesting with all the old buildings, and spaced out well <br>
- niagara region with the vineyards so beautiful, especially in the fall when the vines were heavy and the trees golden fire<br>
- that mideavalesque town with the canal that Assaf and I stopped at on our ontario trip<br>
