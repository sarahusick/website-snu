This blog was inspired by Beltane Day, 3 years ago.
Got up early, walk in the creek, bursting with spring, willow branches strewn on the path from the windy storm last night. Beltane cake and a fresh cofee with ABN onthe deck. Had to do some substitutions for the ingredients I had. Spicy and brought back all the memories, amazing how the falvour can do that. Been celebrating Beltane since 2018 and it's already nostalgic, private and personal, besides a facebook post and celebrating with my fiance. My highscool biology teacher <!--Cheryl Kentner-Hardie--> commented on my fb post she had to look up the holiday, and wondered if it was something her ancestors had celebrated! That made me happy. Some flowers blooming around the neighbourhood around sidewalks. I love when people share their gardens and let them spill right up to the sidewalk for everyone to enjoy.

These are the blossoming trees visible from our deck that remind me of the blossoming branches Guinevre is depicting holding in this enchanting Collier painting, that is part of my all-time art collection.  I dig in my archive each Beltaine to share a may day favorite!

A en plein air study an aquaintance of mine (a very well respected Brandon, MB painter) made today. He makes oil sketches almost daily, for years, and shares them on social media.

Pierogies, my Baba's recipe. A good Ukrainian meal: cabbage, farmer's sausage, and well, delicacy: fresh fiddleheads the neighbours gifted us, so I gifted them some hot pierogies!

I will do a fire later tonight but no pictures. I don't like photos of things that feel sacred. Today from now on, I am trying to shed these old things that have come back: compulsive saving photos, info, scrolling, consuming trash media, behavoriour controlled by web design, news sites. Pandemic has been hard on me for this. I no longer read books. I only have one life to live, how many days left, only the tulips or God knows.<br>

Repairs. 
Wanted to get caught up! Blue jeans, and outside repair. Patched a few, but takes so long; did a quick seam fix for others. I know it's just a short solution. Abn's jeans wear out at the crotch from his bike seat, so I know these seams won't last long. When they give out again, I need denim for my projects, so, it is all good.

Mixing kitchen scraps into potting soil produced fruitful results! Didn't think it'd ripen in so little light but sure enough, it finally turned red! #basementomato

PB cookie 
Left- recipe with flour (also, chocolate kisses like my grandma used to do, well these are rosebuds, I had extra left over)
Right - no flour recipe (Kraft jar : PB, Sugar, Egg). 
Conconclusion: the flourless are easier to make, take longer to bake, a bit greasier, maybe a bit more indulgent, I think the ones with flour make a better allround cookie. <br>

Cooking. Apple "pancake" recipe - more like an omelet! Next time cutting the sugar and butter a bit.  How perfect a sandwich looks after a good grocery shop! Down to about 3 shops per 2 weeks! $200-250 2 people, with healthy food and the option to buy something fancy ingredients to try new recipies. (1 Valu-Mart run, 1 specialty run to the Meat/cheese/fancy store, and 1 emergency run to the Chinese market for produce later in the week, usually.

Prefer doing mending on Sunday, but I have such a backlog, and I needed to determine what was to be repaired, what altered (needs more energy/time) and what totally repurposed as material.<br>
Oh yeah! Never wearing safety pins for long times- alter the clothes! Snaped myself on a safety pin that was holding home pants together for a long time. Don't be lazy!<br>
<img src="../media/blog-posiespockets/repair/20210410_190341.jpg" style="width:220px;height:400px;"><br>Surprised/hopeful for next generation that even flash fashion (assuming, as I got it thrift/swap) still contains extra button sewn in side for ppl to do repairs, because I don't know many people do this, or think they have the time for it. Repairing flash fashion is a waste of time, but it's all I got. I was directed to this Instagrammer's practise of "saving" jeans, the direct was from a winnipeg vintage boutique, and they were laughing at other accounts that call themselves "vintage" when they are not, and yes, fair critique, but this lady is doing a thing and she's good at it and enjoying it so whatever! But on the other other hand, I know it's useless repairing *some* flash fashion. Even worse when it contains so much vinyl/polyester I can't use it for a cleaning/painting rag. But I just want to take care and preserve what I got for as long as possible.<br>

- I'm not discplined enough to pursue diets, but I'm interested in making my own of things that I normally buy, for economy, flavour, simplicity, self-sustenance, and health (you control the sugar, salt, and no preservatives, of course, and these crackers happen to have no added surgar/salt)

Meal planning. Trying to chip away at list of friend-given recipies, bucket list (I've always wanted to try to make Bubble Tea), and get into the habit of making my own sauces instead of store bought (less preservatives/additives, fresher tasting and customizable, and you don't have something sitting in your fridge forever (but on the other hand, more work to make meals, but hey its the pandemic), and less landfil plastic, and more classy) (fromscratch.com helped alot), and my owned recipe books (and Zines!).  I spend a lot of time copying everything off the internet onto recipe cards, because I can't stand looking for recipes, getting phone dirty in kitchen, phone turns off, swimming in ads, and hard to write notes on the recipe. Also I write in my recipe books a checkmark and review when I make them.<br>
<img src="../media/blog-posiespockets/cooking/20210324_151236.jpg" style="width:220px;height:400px;"><img src="../media/blog-posiespockets/cooking/20210324_151246.jpg" style="width:220px;height:400px;"> <br>
- trying to wrap my head around the differences between : rice wine, sake, miran, and rce wine vinegar, and soy sauce lite; there seems to be lighter Chinese versions of Japanese sauces
- Japanese mayo : Kewpie
- how to make things safely with raw eggs
- Bubble Tea was found to be unsafe in Germany, in one study. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea
- it's so interesting to me how cheese is made in only one region, and only pale imitations are made elsewhere, such as Parmigiano-Reggiano. I checked ours in the fridge, and yes, it's authentic, not like the container we always have at my parents, and had growing up.
- lots of times I'm feeling guilty that I have time to experiment with new food, to internalize a healthy, economical and interesting repertoire. I remember my childhood, how much my mom baked and cooked, for huge families, constantly, and I am defensive when someone looks down on the odd processed thing we used (deli meat, dressings, kraft dinner, etc) when I comprehend the sheer responsibility of cooking 3 meals a day for 7 people, for the last 30 years (my brother turns 30 this year). 
- that ingredient wine is sold in grocery stores and doesn't require an ID ut technically you could use it to get drunk ... is theis ever a problem? why isn't this exploited by kids. 
- where to buy safe seaweed that doesn't have "may contained mercury" warnings, seems only place would be to order online and I avoid that as MUCH as possible. 
- Places I will be shopping : Valu-mart, Moberly's Royal Beef, Chinese dep and Bulk Barn. 
- I am constantly pulled by the sense that I should research traditional diet of my anscestors which is local and mroe simple, and less dependent on imports and cultural trends, and the desire to "taste the world" and explore traditional diets and plants, ingredients of other regions, and the artistic innovation of fusion due to increased, reliable, prolific global trade. And be considered pretentious, hipster by trying trends or efforts to have more ethical food consumption (envrinoment, ppl, animal welfare, etc). Torn. <br><br>

Some directions are ambiguous, and i don't know what stitch used with the machine, (when you turn the seam inside out and stictch it again... what stitch is that? a running stitch that just creates a new seam? Ended up quite small, hurt to wear, fit chin so so well, and the fabrci looked store bought, just there was this beak at the top, and I tried to fix, and just couldn't, it escalated and I could salvage it. Also the big dip created by the two plates curves, causes a lot of pressure on the ears from the string / elastic bending down so low to meet the fabric. 
- 3rd time !! Used a hand drawn pattern this time, four peices( runing out of the black apron fabric. Took 2 1/2 days. Got it!  Did not do the second seam sew on other side. Fixed seams (took them in) by reversing,not hackng the edges (duh!) I'm so proud! There was by accident a print of a gold anchor from the apron I was upcycling for black fabric, and I kept it, so cewl! The front looks bought, the seams on the side are a bit irregular. Used the cut off seams form the apron for the ear bands, not the black elastic (hurt). So comfy, andI can speak !! Yay!!

5 Minutes🔥🔥How to make Face mask. Very easy DIY Face mask. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IcIojJdnDk&ab_channel=RinDIY
 completed in 2 hours, not 5 mins, though I had problems and am a beginner. No sewing machine, used stretchy cloth rather than stiff cotton, ruler is dirty and hard to read so measurements not exact, lol, no iron to press seams (though prob little difference w/ this type of fabric), no fabric marker and stretchy fabric v. hard to get a perfect square. End result is a mask that fits and doesn't slide on Assaf - "L" size on website (30 x 30 cm) .  Great first experience! Their seam allowance : 0.5 cm, mine quite close to that but it's not super even, nor is my stitching for that matter. The shape was alright, but I think I didn't draw it out very well, either.
