Challenges of paper embroidery:
- no thread holding holes apart, so the holes just join, you can't do very close long stitch as the threads just break eachother's holes and the thread comes loose. ALSO : holes don't heal so every poke to see where you are is viisble, so have to be very careful not to make mistake holes.

Collections (lifelong, or new collections made containing 2 decades old material belonging to me) to be made into artworks. Items that hold nostalgic or aesthetic interest for me. Clothes scraps for quilts, Picture File for numerous projects. One I intend to use up as soon as possible; the Picture File I do like maintaining; you can play cames with it or use it for painting reference or new, unplanned collage projects.

The big dick energy, all white euro male artists? Yes, this truly does represent humanity. Our primitive monkey societies letting arbitrary biological differences create biases and symbols and we choose to represent all of us. Very embarrassing. Of course warhol puts a penis. Maybe he thought it was a stupid project too. It's embarrasing. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque
How the man is facing the viewer and initiating communication, and the woman is standing contrapostal, modestly turning away, her body to be gazed on. Stupid modernism, backwards 60s.  The chapter on Sagan's conumdrum to include the genital slit in the woman is so bizarre, so glad this article documents it. > oh, reading into the article, I see there was criticsm that echoed my first impression of the depiction. And oh man, the man started out with an afro and ended up with a suburban american white guy haircut. lol 
> so the debates that surrounded the human figures depiction is really interesting here; the power to create a visual representation of humanity was so contenious and it muffled out the debate with NASA's choice

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman > The first picture of an engineer!!! <3 <3 very proud of this article. , now *this* is what I'd send to aliens to represent humanity.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioArt "BioArt has been scrutinized for its apparent lack of ethics. USA Today reported that animal rights groups accused Kac and others of using animals unfairly for their own personal gain, and conservative groups question the use of transgenic technologies and tissue-culturing from a moral standpoint.[3]" -- this is a really important point, and I have to admit I was thinking about this when I kept pet mice hoping they would be part of my thesis show, though the experience, I'm 99.9% sure was completely casual for PPE to do the video, she explored a new box with objects inside, then when back to her home. But yes this is so important, and would prevent me further from using animals in art, if I wasn't confident I'm incoveniencing htem in no way.

Collage/embroidery project.
- Ghosts of past 3 years haunt (mfa), weigh me down as I work.
- i am unable to disassociate the material from the concept. Each image from the Picture File (collected since childhood). A collection of physical images : time and space to store it (and presumably other things) - privilige. Childhood craft - home stability and possible hoarding that I would have such old items. Clippings from rural/agriculture newspapers: rural culture, a portrait of central rural canadian identity and farmers. Stock imagery and the information booklet (the support for the collages) - a stable address, and life that you have opened a bank account. Cutouts from print media in general: nostalgia, from early 2000s.  Clippings from plant packages : privilege that had the time and location to live where there was space to have a garden.  (these are associations I assume an audience could make). THEN there are the personal associations: each craft kit, toy magazine, event pamplet, university or highschool or elementary school project scrap: many of the photos in the Picture File I know exactly where they come from and it brings a flood of memories for me. I keep the Picture File for crafts but also a modified game of "apples to apples", but the file is huge and I add to it now and then, so it's more of an exchange. It does contain a lot of "Vintage" images. I try to cleanse it now and then of half cut scraps , try only to keep good pictures, and keep collage scraps elsewhere.<br>

Why stars should think twice before calling out their critics
https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/apr/29/why-stars-should-think-twice-before-calling-out-their-critics-lizzo-lana-del-rey-carey-mulligan
> i see the other side, though, as an artist, and the dismissive and entrenched dog atic institution of critique can kill an artist and waste what potential they had to form new ideas. Also, artists can speak for themselves, and offer their own contextualisation.  Sometimes critics demand a secure profession for themselves, even when they've become dogmatic and outdated, or repetitive.<br>

I am always fascinated with the look of projects before they are done, it's like the beauty of improv, or the sparse abstract joy of a work in progress. 
<img src= "../media/dcim-studio/2021-eastlynn/20210423_100437.jpg"> <br>
Invented abstraction and added a dark shadow where there is none, as it made sense in the drawing. In the end, you are mostly done with photographic information and it is just down to making the drawing work, which was adding a shadow with a navy pencil. Writing this down makes me stressed, and if I thought about it while doing it, in words, or tried to follow steps, I'd get stressed. That's what I like about working, it's a non-literary intellectual activity, no words in the brain or mouth, but there are complex thoughts and processes, just it's a new task to articulate them to words.

Mom's Bouquet series. Returning to representation after so long is has been nerve wracking, so much so that I couldn't bare to go in with pencil and draw properly, rationally, so just calmy let each bouquet bloom off the page without thinking too much, no correcting or pencil. minimal pallete. Been so wonderful to be back, and surprsingly easy, comes just natural without trying, results not catastrophic. Feel I have a painterly approach with the pencils, I scribble and push layers of pigment onto the surface, layer it up. not the right paper for watercolour, but I had set this stack asside for this project for so long, and it's the pandemic: no shopping, and I loath the thought of online shopping! Avoiding it all costs! So you make do with what you have!

April 20 2021

Listening to live concert: (my former profs) BU Pro Series April 20 2021 7:30 UTC Live FB Stream concert: Nanny Hennan, and other (Kerry DuWors, Sarah Hall, Paul Madrigas). So mcuh lovely variety from French Baroque and much more contemporary. Was surprised: first time seen the piano accompianist was reading sheet music off a tablet! Looked very professional and reasonable, just first time I saw it! Concert was a lovely evening treat. But it is so hard to concentrate and treat it as performance, not just music in the background to work to (which I did). 

Listening to a Talk by Morgan Grobin (Microsoft, program manager) and others on PIX a game optimization tool, stream on Facebook. 99.97% was complete over my head but astonishing the layers of teams and tools to create a single game, and this was a tool that could look for and fix slight graphic nuances like pixel noise on a frozen stream in a game setting. It was phenomenal, and just before: I was reviewing with my students (grade 7-8) about Le Corbusier's concept of the Engineer-Aesthetic in Vers une architecutre (1923) and here was his concept, teams of software engineers to perfect the rendering of this leaf's shadow in a location in a game. Really astounding.

Grading my middle schoolers/high schooler's assignments on Modern Architecture Styles all yesterday, and watching Star Wars Clone Wars S2 E 12 - 13 at the end of the day, couldn't help but admire the variety of architectural styles and imagination: there was reference to futurism, metablosim (moduls), and that stunning art nouveau hallway in which a battle took place, my growing admiration of the artwork (along with engaging writing and world building) really peaked. OF course this was set up in the art of the films, but I think they pushed the aesethics (cultural world building) much further.
While unable to find an image of the fantastic hall, with its notable blue lighting and organic, plant-like archways in the battle scene, was able to find these: 
<img src= "../media/found-artaesthetic-all/clone_wars_arch_styles/tcw-s2-e13-0203.webp"> 
City skyline: Futurism, brutalism

Japanese Metabolism (note the cubed modules and complementary cubed trees lining the path (wow) )
<img src= "../media/found-artaesthetic-all/clone_wars_arch_styles/tcw-s2-e13-0203.webp"> 
Art Nouveau : the guilded luxious soft curving and tendrils in the throne, reminiscent of cathedral.
<img src= "../media/found-artaesthetic-all/clone_wars_arch_styles/tcw_2_13_35.jpg"> 
Art deco, again with the luxurious settings and geometric budes ornamenting the circular podium.
These are just my opinion and I could be off.

DONE! 1 week! So many hours. The longer you sew, the more stitches, the better the rug is, which makes it hard to stop. A toe will stag and pull out the loops with long enough, also not cat proof.  The blue on black rug, due to sewing it carelessly on my lap for a stretch of its life, the oval was compromised, but after much pushing/pulling trying to coax new stitches to find the oval again, decided to embrace the beauty of its unique form.  Final circumfrance stitching to attach the non-slip layer to all five rugs, and cover up the ugly stitches. Two cord types were impossible to pull through, so resorted to (less strong) embroidery floss that I have PLENTY of and in great range of colours-- could find excellent colour matches (was worried about the stark contrast of the cord minimizing the size of the rug). The longer you sew, the more stitches, the better the rug is, so it was very hard to say "finished:. These rugs were made as the Ontario government announced deeper stay at home orders, so was really restricted to what had at home, and I like that feeling, because I have to look around me and solve problems instead of running to Dollarama and buying new. Happy with the five rugs (4 as gifts) plus a tiny keepsake one for myself.

Upcycled canvas bags for bases. First thing sucessfully sewed using machine! So fast, and strong! Game changer. Knotted finger knit chain like umbilical cord, later undid knots as I was sewing that part in the rug, as I found they made an unsavory texture, you could feel it as you stepped on the rug.  Added layer of cotton (bedsheet) to the canvas for extra stability, so the rug isn't so floppy. The stitches are SUPER ugly, so I just happened to find that I had this anti-slip plastic? textile that goes under a rug, so I"m cutting that and sewing it over the rugs after.

<b>Studio > Life</b><br>
Today, rifling through a box of old material saved for post-consumer art projects, I found a pair of brand-new (albeit inexpensive) earings I had purchased a couple years ago in one of those monomaniacal missions of mine to obtain a particular look (and accompanying persona). This time, it was a sophisticated, feminine, formal one owned by one of my colleagues in the MFA program<!--it was Pardiss Armenian-->. Around that time of the triumphant purchase, an art idea ripped through my head: a series of still lifes of purchases, lovingly depicting the price tags and minutia, abbreviated in my mind as "the Marx still lifes" (the frequency which I refer to an idea in my head and personal notes, ends up causing these ideas to get unoffical names, often which stick). So, I set the earrings aside in the studio as a prop for this project, after which had served its art function I would get to finally wear. During two subsequent whirlwind studio moves (Montreal-->Toronto Akin-->Toronto East Lynn, with a summer studio in Manitoba in between [it's complicated, and Covid-19 related]), my studio materials got a bit jumbled. Just now, I discovered and separated some props from this debris to be used for an anthropocene-themed system of work series. It hit me how my social and biological endeavours are hopelessly, pitifully at the mercy of whatever creative enterprise I take on. And there's such a queue line, a complex map of accumated ideas that must be arranged for thematic show and material economy, and other factors (eg. what space I have at the moment), that the side of me that wishes to excell, conform, intentionally master these style/persona/fashion aesethics enivetably get crumbled up, appropriated, submitted on the altar of creative production, and honestly, though it hurts me, that I've never mastered that self-possessed look or skillful makeup application, or just looking put together, or having the tools to express oneself through appearance and selection of clothes, makeup, accessories, hair, posture, etc, but I think I'd have it no other way. <br>

March 08 2021<br>
Going through old collected material from the studio moves. Just handling the objects excites my senses and fill my head with new works, series of works, theories and plans. I wrote them down on the whiteboard. I feel like I need a blank surface to get all the ideas out quickly, because if I get caught up writing them properly, I forget them very quickly. I then add the ideas to my digital research notebook (I use straight html now, for a lightweight system, that can link and visually display any files), and add the art ideas to a map, which allows me to see the order to create projects based on what materials they need (some projects need all the remainder of a type of material I have, some specific objects, so I make those first, or works that are some how time sensitive or extra combersome to store the supplies, etc. <br>
