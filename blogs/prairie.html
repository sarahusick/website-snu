Education Bill 64 Manitoba 

AN OPEN LETTER TO RURAL MANITOBA CITIZENS

By Robert MacTavish
As featured in The Minnedosa Tribune

Four weeks ago the Provincial Government unveiled its Education Modernization Act, the culmination of a review of K to 12 education in Manitoba.

Interested groups, citizens and agencies had the opportunity to make presentations to the Review Commission which was charged with the responsibility of gathering opinions and writing recommendations to shape education for the next generation.

Numerous School Divisions were presenters to the commission and argued for a student-centered, locally controlled authority that would ensure that the wishes of parents, care givers and the wider community would be reflected in any changes mandated by the province.

The commission heard from many presenters that student success was predicated on stable communi- ties, an absence of poverty and poor nutrition, curricular that reflected local interests and demands and funding that kept up with inflation.

It became obvious when the Minister of Education, Mr. Cliff Cullen, released the proposed legislation, Bill 64, that the government had chosen to simply ignore many key recommendations and, unilaterally, create a new model for authority over education in Manitoba.

The core of the new legislation would give the Premier and an appointed Education Authority of six-to-10 people absolute control over all education matters everywhere in the province, with the exception of those schools in the Franco-Manitoban school division.

Claiming that parents were essential, Pallister stated that representative parents would comprise an Advisory council, one that would have no real authority.

All school divisions would be dissolved, all elected school trustees would cease to hold office, effective June 30th, 2022. School boards would no longer be employers, they would no longer be in a position to hire tradespeople, purchase goods, supervise teachers and educational assistants, design effective bus routes, offer new programming for immigrant or special needs students, develop policies that supported better mental health among students.

All of those functions would fall to an appointed body in Winnipeg.

Our rural divisions have, quite simply, too much to lose. Western Manitoba is characterized by small towns of hard-working people, who want their children taught in their own communities.

Any moratoriums, real or intended, on school closures are gone.

Limits on school bus routes will be determined in Winnipeg.

The beating hearts of rural towns, the local schools, will be viewed only as expenses by a government committed to reducing costs.

Make no mistake, Pallister’s Conservatives see only in terms of perceived efficiencies. The fact that school board amalgamations save no money doesn’t seem to register with this government.

Programs and relationships that have been years in the making will be severed. Partnerships in Beautiful Plains School Division with Hutterite Colony students have proven highly successful and valued.

Inclusive courses for Indigenous students in Fort La Bosse School Division that have really worked will be in peril. Turtle Mountain School Division has been recognized for its’ extensive support to preschoolers.

Because local school boards existed, they were able to craft policies and pro- grams that reflected local issues and concerns. Without local boards, programming decisions will be made by the Premier’s office in Winnipeg.

How can a few people in ‘the city’ reasonably make appropriate decisions about varying rural needs?

In addition, the jobs lost in our rural communities will be significant. The government has continually justified their actions by stating they will cut millions of dollars from the administrative layers out of the education system.

They haven’t actually said what they will do, where the money will go or how it is to actually improve our schools. But the reality is they are bent on getting rid of school board offices and that means a lot of people who worked there.

Those employees, many of whom are highly skilled and active in their communities, will simply have to pack up and move to find employ- ment elsewhere. The economic loss of board offices and employees will be a bitter blow to many towns!

What then is proposed? How will the Premier ensure that students perform better? He has put all decision- making power in an appointed body, the Education Authority, in Winnipeg. He has committed to appointing 15 regional Education Directors, whose duty it is to carry out the wishes of the Education Authority.

The directors will be civil servants, requiring no advanced degrees in education or pedagogy. And they will be accountable to only the Premier and cabinet.

The Premier has promised to increase the voice of local parents. He has mandated that every school will have a School Community Council, composed of volunteers who will review and advise: the school principal on programming, student performance, student behaviour issues and school policies, on budgets and monthly expenditures, on any capital construction projects, on student transportation issues and on the hiring of all staff, determining when any employee requires a performance appraisal.

And just to see that parents rise to the task, the school principal will be required to appoint one employee from the school to act as a Parent Engagement worker!

I’m not sure our present parent volunteers signed up for this! In fact, I know that the vast majority of parents are so busy working and committed to providing opportunities for their growing families to take on this kind of role.

Most Parent Advisory groups have worked tirelessly to assist teachers, administrators and local boards in improving the overall school climate with great initiatives such as playground improvements, new chairs for the gyms and the like.

Their volunteer assistance in the classrooms is too large to measure. They are a crucial part of the process. We need parents to help us structure a system that fully takes into account every student’s needs.

But we can’t have a system that takes all the work that the school board and superintendent did and simply pass it to a volunteer parent body and hope it will function effectively. Despite the best efforts of any parent group, this is a recipe for a colossal failure. It won’t be any one’s fault, it will be the sure result of a very bad decision; that is, to remove the school board and its elected trustees from the equation!

In closing, I would point out that, in the proposed legislation, Bill 64, there is absolutely nothing that speaks to how we can see better results for our students.

There is nothing that addresses the greatest hindrance to achievement, which is poverty and social disadvantage.

In a province with the highest child poverty and highest children in care rates, this is mind boggling.

The Premier assures us that better results will come because there will be mandated provincial testing at the primary, middle years and senior level.

How naive and foolish, what a regressive step this will be.

Lastly, although some may see it as remote or esoteric, I feel we are surely losing some of the real democracy that others fought to protect; essentially, the right to vote for those who make important decisions about our lives and our communities.

We lost local voice in health care, now it’s education that is under attack.

The education we, and possibly your children, have experienced here in rural Manitoba has been the sum of local efforts to respond to what people have wanted, could afford, and have dreamed for future generations.

That relationship between citizens and those held accountable, your trustees, will soon be gone forever.

The elections held in 2018 will be the last ones ever. If you have any concerns regarding your schools in the future, you are invited to write or visit the Premier’s office on Broadway in the Manitoba Legislature.

Oh, and it should be mentioned that under the proposed legislation, only parents will have this right; non-parents, grandparents, uncles and aunts have no say, all non-parents will lose the right to express a view on the matter.

That’s the future... unless people tell their MLA, or the Minister of Education, Mr. Cliff Cullen, or the Premier, Mr. Brian Pallister, that what is proposed is not good enough; that what we want is a real say in what education our children and their children will enjoy!

Rural Manitoba is our home and we want it to offer the best in a changing world that increasingly demands graduates with world class skills. I urge you to stand up for our students, now and for the future.
