Succuss! Still wobbly, a problem. I don't want to permantly damage my music stand. I just don't want to buy a dress form, another object in the basement, and trying to cut costs!

Sewing! Making a Dress form.  I saw this on the internet and it didn't work out that well for me. Stuffing it and forming with manual labour/sculpting.

Bought my first sewing machine! Guy down Danforth, answered a Kijiji ad. Really hard to figure out, I know it's very basic but it's new. Watching YT videos. Needed to speed up the sewing or else it'll be an eternity!
