05-10-21 CBC Gem's Farm Crime - S1 and 2. Takes you all over Canada, meets interesting people. A variety of recent stories. The intrepid detective work and collaboration with RCMP, or on your own sleuthing, (the memorable Murder Hornets epsisode, some actualy information about the sensational story which much ado was made in 2020) doesn't put forth a vigilante message but more the care and passion these farmers and livetock or land owners and their communities have for their way of life, that is sustainable and traditional. A true showcase of this. The script was a bit collequial and annoying, sometimes "where the hell did their lobsters go", eh.  Hope for more seasons!

Heartland Ep 1 Season 14 - childhood CBC ads for this show, never got to watch it. Drama looks heartfelt and Canadian - woot! But sort of forumlaic, guilty pleasure character arcs or "proving character development" like Vampire Diaries, etc. A country/horse drama spanning such a time interests me except it's sort of boring white people. Felt like it wasn't challengin enough, but the emotional reward is when you were along with these characters (Amy's husband dies, so flashback from former seasons of them falling in love). Season 1 wasn't available so can't compair -- I love comparing actresses over time, see how they change. 

Dowtown Abby - Season 1 Episode 1 - 1 hour long, only the first epsiode, and I was Amazed at the complexity and profoundness of the compelling, beleivalbe plot, realism, characters that have consistency and agency (unlike heartland you feel the characters are acting the script, the plot, a bit). I know the criticism and am guilty in this indulgent satisfaction of class difference in the British system, but I feel the portrayal of the working class versus the lord ship layer is fascinating, nuanced. And a homosexual relationship in the first episode, with class tensions : quite progressive, surprised as many of my (older) relatives into this show. Quite

05-08-21 The Invention of Lying . Intersting thought experiment: would there be no art? Casinos? Clear it was Gervais who wrote this film from his beliefs, a more contrite character than we're used to seeing, not really about lying but about forming meaning making and hope.

- important issue, and glad there is Indigenous represetation on MMIW. But is there line where it crosses into prudish conservatism, that is against sex positivity, reducing protection and and destigmatizing sex workers, and the ridiculous position of banning porn, as if anything sexy is villainous? does the mythology harm the cause of ending exploitation of minors and domestic abuse? sometimes right/left politics obscures the actual issue. 
I think I found it:

Potentially yes. This and similar programs work by making your default tab load into a page with a bunch of ads on it, and the revenue from those ads is what is used to fund the research. As an extension it would also have access to user info and that may also be used... simple things cookies track mostly like what ads you click, what pages you visit, etc. I find it kind of sketchy their website explains none of this anywhere easy to access.

Magic Mike - a moody, chronically yellow-tinted slowburn drama, not the peppy chickflick you were in for. Feels like an exploitation film; alernates between loose end plot and murmered "realism" dialogue of mike's life and striving to realize his dreams, managing the "Dark" life with the "light" life, the banks deny him the loan to start out his career (unusual he needs more than $13K to begin an arts studio, esp with construction experience..) and highly polished dance sequences that are completely removed from the story, and don't really tell the story through the sequences, they are all elaborate choreographed, perfect moments, which makes it feel like I'm forced to take a break from plot and be frequently titallated by Tatum and Mahonauney's dancing; seems like a "talent show off" movie, an excuse. Other way of looking at it: reversed gender roles at the beginning, but the men exploring other modes of masculinity, being the exploited not the exploiter, the problematics of the gaze, isn't really explored here, and the writers wish no morals to be said; the ltitle brother carries off into the sunset and the vertran protagonist male leaves the stripper life behind to be domesticated and pursue honest business (and artistic dream). This roough Flashdance spinoff fails to catpure the courage and struggle that the underdog is undergoing to pursue the nightlife and break away from it to get the Good Girl and the domestic business/passion. Is furniture his true passion, or is dancing/nightlife? The dancing sequences are just removed from the story, the movie itself, inside them it never shows Tatum's character revealed, anything changing, towards "I don't like this, this is stealing my soul" the audience (us) is just pushed to be in the gaze of the clientele, we are never afforded a more serious look during these performances.  
There are no serious consquences from the "ultimate male stripper life." The female hoard versus The Non Slut Desireable Good Girl versus the Free Lesbian that was lying about the fiance, and the Femme Fatale (with the pig) never explored again... the categories of the women weren't really blurred, they are archetpyes (tired). I feel like it was inconsistant, and wants me to be titallated by the lavish awesome lifestyle, yet be fascinated by the realism and stuttered dialgue. That nauseating extreme yellow filter I haven't seen so obvious since South Pacific (1958).. but even they knew to just use it for one emphasis scene! I actually enjoyed the movie, it made me think (and debate with my bf) about what movies should be, how stories can be told.  The talent and watability of Tatum/Horn/Mahonauy was perfect. In terms of a complete story or movie, soemthing fell short, and if it was "meaningless realism" that it was going for, peppering it with polished, removed dance performances was a bit inconsistent. But maybe that's what they're going for. The hurricane going on outside the window, showing the undercurrent of change/dissent in the stripper gang at the party: should I try drawing a metaphor? Contrasted in my mind was Hustlers; which was a less realistic, but undercurrent of femminism / economic inequality, hustle to the top, cheat the billionaries, but in becoming what they loathed, I found it fell short of examinating anything much there, either. This movie avoids such clear achretypes like "the younglings gang up onthe leader that is epxloiting them; the newbie gets taken under the wing then rebels against the vetran that brings them in", so that was refreshing, a bit.  Very jumbled thoughts, you can see.

That's My Wife - season 2. Cute ending, with Teagan and Sara cameo that was rewarding, woot! Surprised I recognized them. Was kind of glad they ended the after-explainations, they were good for the first season. Through the show, sometimes the added laugh tracks to show they are funny were just a bit off... and cringe. The plot follows those types of resolutions that we're familiar with "relationship/psychological" resolutions that reassure/reaffirm them believing in themselves or the relationship, which is ok if you like that. The show was funnier in season 1 and early season 2, I was really annoyed at the second last episode, the one (of ocurse) I showed my bf (and it was like all talking and not much happened.) I miss pre-covid times.  That is all.  I'm constantly angry when I see tv shows enjoying life with others, in buildings, and being sick, coming to work, etc. All the things we took for granted. Siigh.

CBC Gem _ Season 1. That's My Wife. A genre I haven't seen before, quite: fiction based on the show's creators, that almost is their lives. Slice of Life, two female comics, a couple, navigate social, political issues of being female and gay comics, in L.A., through humour and light story. I find the writing very fresh and funny; jokes very Now, very millenial, and very watchable and wholesome. IF you are not of the gay persuasion or patience for millenial humour/existence, not your cup of tea. Each espiode recaps with the protagonists/creators, Rhea and Camryn, discuss the theme of the show in a seemingly spontaneous and candid discussion and how it relates to their lives. What strikes me is you can tell society "accept me" and be politically correct, but you can't tell someone to "laugh", it is an art. And that's what's interesting, and they do. Admirable how they can swim through very real and heavy issues lightly, laugh at it without being flippant; giving you the idea that that's their strategy dealing with the harsh social reality, is raising awareness and struggling by things by laughter; it disarms and unempowers the forces they're against. Manage to not categorize people into "goodies" and "baddies" > a character, an established white male comic who makes a rape joke that triggers the protagonist Rhea, ends up working with both characters, mentoring them, and learning from them.<br>

13 Going on 30, the dance scene. Why Thriller? It's not only a collective , feel-good indulgence in nostalgia for the mid 30s characters, it's a celebration of mass media and media for the common man, in world of pretensious "high art/high fashion" , what makes it such a strong scene and plot point.

Colette (2018) While somewhat predictable plot wise of the actress/genre (literary female, abusive husband takes credit, steamy crowd-pleasing lesbian scenes), it was thoroughly complete and compelling retelling of this admirable historical story. I was engrossed and loved every minute. And talk about non preachy, extremely relevant story (feminism and trans autonomy).  I really liked the illustration of how art movements at the time were bursting through people's minds and standards, and the backdrop of paris in 1900 is as good as any to highlight this.

You know, the first time I learned about this was actually when I was a little girl, from the Bible. 2 Samuel 13 when Amon rapes his sister Tamar, then right after "hated her with intense hatred." (NIV) and tells her to GTFO and she's like noo don't send me out, so yeah

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22_(logic)

"At another point in the book, a prostitute explains to Yossarian that she cannot marry him because he is crazy, and she will never marry a crazy man. She considers any man crazy who would marry a woman who is not a virgin. This closed logic loop clearly illustrated Catch-22 because by her logic, all men who refuse to marry her are sane and thus she would consider marriage; but as soon as a man agrees to marry her, he becomes crazy for wanting to marry a non-virgin, and is instantly rejected."

Toy story inspiration : 

"Real isn't how you are made," said the Skin Horse. "It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real."

"Does it hurt?" asked the Rabbit.

"Sometimes," said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. "When you are Real you don't mind being hurt."

From Dask Til Dawn Tag: film review
(Assaf) and later that night Sabrina (Tina). thinking about these two films, compare, what is ommon. The 'kitsch' area, the one that "fills the desires" it is violence and gore and camp in dtd and romance gushiness, couture fashion in sabrina. fdtd has the genre filp from compelling (and annoyingly annoying creep QT with the (self-aware) epitome of the male gaze, then the camp sepecial affects. The final scene of the temple very cool. Sabrina an indulgent american elitest cinderella story , but it's sweet and so charming, and tina mentioned how the clothes customed designed by Gucci ? , films even then were walking advertisements, or works of art depending how you see it. Comparing the two films: both brothers dealing with some economic enterprising, fighting, the girl wins in the end, goes through a transformation. Sabrina seems the early "emily in paris" and glam-up grow-up film formula. I barely got thru fdtd many times just because the violence against women, so cringe. It's interesting why the first half is dragged out so long. 
where'd you go bernadette - loved it, was ketpial at firs,t the props brilliantly made. fall into the romantic trope of artist represent in films? deftly side step them a little, a story of getting back and creating. so optimistic and positive. deeply inspiring.<br><br>

I just want to know if two dutch braids are ok... they are called dutch afterall, and braiding is central in european culture, ukrainian where i come from, and very practical, even necessary for me to manange my hair... but on fb someone was rocking her brave stand to wear her two braids... is this racist for me to do it? > it isn't a ceremonial headdress, which i think is at least insensitve, if not wrong. Specific design or article of clothing. but braiding hair? The stigma should be put down against black women wearing their hair, not gatekeeping something as fundamental as braiding one's hair to manage it.  And The gorrilla glue incident reminded me that black hair care in north america is an acutal problem and ppl don't have the products they need. I think that's so sad that natural hair is still considered unprofrofessional in some workplaces.. that's enraging.

Updated July 13, 2018
It's not. Whose culture would it be appropriating?

People think it is because braids are such a big part of black hairstyling. However, they are by no means exclusive, and white people, Hispanics, Asians, etc… have all worn Dutch (cornrow), French, and plain ol’ three-strand braids for centuries. Heck, some are even named after the Dutch and French (can you imagine?!?!)

Buzzfeed seems to think that the instant I wear more than two Dutch braids, I'm appropriating black culture. What “cornrows” are to black people are also “convenient and secure fighting hairstyle” to boxers a.k.a “boxer braids,” and “inverted French braids” or “Dutch braids” to Western hairstylists, for precision of language in describing a technique (Lois Lowry has permanently tattooed the importance of that into my mind.) Fulbe women have been creating intricate braided styles for centuries. Tibetan women wear 108 box braids because it is auspicious and sacred to them, and young Uyghur women wear them because it’s traditional. Cornrows are another style of braid that is, in this country, usually seen on black people. To me, it’s just a style that is pretty and suitable for my hair. My hair is too thick to fit into two braids; so I usually wear three, like in my profile pic. Maybe for some people it’s a big cultural thing and is loaded with meaning, but it’s not going to be that way for everybody. What this article sounds like is someone complaining that not everyone does things the way she does.

I have absolutely zero tolerance for those who unnecessarily bring up cultural appropriation over something as insignificant as braids. The whole “they're all called cornrows and belong only to black people” argument is complete and utter garbage.

And please, never listen to Buzzfeed when it comes to social issues. The article confused you because it's, again, complete BS. Using their logic, white people can’t wear bandanas, black people can’t wear scarves to bed, and my best friend can stop wearing a beanie to school because Muslim women are discriminated against for wearing hijab. Seriously, I could debunk the entire article sentence by sentence, but I'm far past my breaking point already."

Quora can be a dumpster fire.

W/ ABN. ULS. Parasite (2019) Tightly wound, exquisitely directed, edited, acted, created thriller-comedy-drama with a message about rich and poor gap, the desperation to move upward into a cozy place, how we are products of our environment, and how life never works out, and the cost of tenacity and persistance. Terrifying and wonderful film. Didn't like the Indian motive, the director gavce a PR statement of the metaphor of shallow Indian mytholody relates to story, which is obvious to me, but this is a common PR guesture (you still represent the sterotype, and nothing is done to mitigate it). But this is minor and I'm not dying on this hill with this particular film. Personally I related to this experience being a poor grad student getting into the nanny game in richer Montreal families, and having very good and bad experiences, and feeling that I was, a parasite too.<br><br>

Pfeiifer nad DeNiro are fantastic and fully committed, also postive gender fluid representation, or challenge to masculinity, that is a positive message.

Tomorrow is officially, I hate BellLet'sTalk day.  Reminded because my Healthcare of Concordia Grad student assocation partnered with them again and sent me an email advertising for Bell. 
- first off, as a counter point to all below, they do give some 100K cash injections once a year into some good charities, and if it saves 1 life it's hard to say "don't do it".  But then you consider all the adverstising for providing shitty internet service, being a jerky company to begin with, and how much they actually make, it's a really small amount of cash and in fact a super SUPER CHEAP ADVERTISING campaign that all of Facebook does for them WTF ,,,, going on for so many years, I dread this day and hate this companys guts. the problem wiht internet providers is often you don't have a choice, esp in rural communities. 
-mental health needs to be public infrustructure, not paid by donations of corp's
- bell donates to a charity for you to do FREE ADVERTISING 
- many people also hate bellletstalk day.
-"all awareness is good awareness" > no, no it's not. we can end mental health stigma without bell advertising 
https://nowtoronto.com/news/bell-let-s-talk-day-part-of-the-mental-health-problem-2
"Because the reality of mental illness is far from anything that would be approved in a boardroom. It is not clean or clear or pretty; it does not follow a definably upward trajectory. It is messy, ugly, and sad; it often gets much worse before it gets better; when it does get better it never really goes away; and when it is combined with poverty and racism it can become intractable."
https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2019/01/30/how-bells-lets-talk-campaign-harms-people-it-aims-to-help.html?rf

There are plenty more articles about critisizing this tonedeaf campaign.

The Milkmaid - film - a powerful emotional tale, gripping story of oppression.  Was a bit confused in the first half putting the characters and story together b/c flashbacks, to north american viewer might be idorietned, the film doesn't try to document it as a political event, offering no location/date tags. seems to generalize the conflict to these sisters' story.  The musical score and visual vibrancy of the woman's colours in cothing, costume and makeup transformation was stellar, super effective in the story telling, and the landscapes were also beautiful, yet the film doesn't pander to our senses, it just shows the vibrancy of the tribal life . Perhaps felt simplistic, as in we get that the religious extremsits are bad, and the sister is caught up in it.  An experience, reminds me how much i take for granted, how much suffering there is in the world. So different from a nigerian storyteller than the american films made about modern african conflict .

As far as rules go, the most important difference between racquetball and squash is that the ceiling is out of bounds in squash but not racquetball. ... Racquetball players must also bounce the ball once against the floor before serving, while squash players don't.

"Critics point out that most of the content on Substack is far from original journalism: It¡¯s mostly research, opinion, and analysis of news from traditional outlets. Also, the writing generally does not go through a rigorous editing process like at a traditional news outlet, leaving more room for inaccuracies (and worse). And, solo journalists miss out on things like professional training and resources to pursue bigger stories."

The Case Against The Jedi Order https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUPD1w78D5I&ab_channel=PopCultureDetective > hit my points that I felt, too. 

"Kenneth Bryant

jedi are contradictory. George wanted them to be like samurai, knights, old western marshals and monks all at once. But samurai, knights and marshals had wives and children. They weren't chaste warriors. Monks don't engage in violence but share the pledge to abstain from strong emotions and have penitence for their transgressions. If George Lucas wanted his jedi to be monks, they shouldn't carry lightsabers or be violent at all. An order of emotionless warriors who kill in self-defense shouldn't be seen as the police force of a universe."

Home Alone - watched again.  Remember the beating up adults painful injury part as much longer, it's actually v. shrot. the reason this movie is so enduring is its melancholoy moments. 

Clueless - v. excited for this precursure of Mean Girls, and was enjoying it greatly, until the sharp tidy and meaningless ending, leaving me with a greater appreciation for the more constructive Mean Girls.  Clueless sets up several intersting questions : Is Cher selfish? (can she do a sacrificial kindness, not dumping her excess clothes at a Drive.  Does she have direction? Her skills of debating, organizing, aesthetics, can these be recognized by the people around her?  How does she reconcile her valuing virginity against a culture that is shaming her for being a virgin? How does it address her emotional affect of being flirted against her will and robbed, or her friend getting bullied by some boys at the mall? How does she learn to accept consequences to her actions (arguing out of grades). How will she resolve the love triangle?  I won't even expect a question about weatlh, class, privilige.  How do these interesting things tie up? oh, the friend falls out of love with the brother, the brohter falls in love with her, in a limp and terrifying ending, recognizes her for her "Beauty, and youth" ... then the ex step brother is a COLLEGE student, kisses the 15 year old and YAY HAPPY ENDING.  WTF.  The ending had me seeing this film, as well, Clueless.  Disappointing. I haven't read Emma so I'm just judging this as an opportunity to be progressive 90s flick and representation of a girl's struggles, and there it falls flat.  Yes, I was watching it for what it was, a fun chickflick, but the question they chose to answer, was the college guy getting with the 15 year old, how is that not yuck !

Mandolorina 2 - World building 10/10, but the story is so flat, the characters and motivations so unconvincing, low stakes. The final episode gideon moss simply narrates every action that is happening, it's so stupid, takes me out of the story.  Stan Sebastion !!! Does an execellent luke, but what was wiht the speech? looked cgi.  they are using the old currency of these beloved characters built up, but that curreny is running out, b/c these charactes are stupid and forgettable-- mando's obsession/love for baby yoda, never really was understandable, it wasn't shown to us, it was just told at one episode oh, now he cares so much for baby yoda, like why, how, does he feel like a father, a freidn, a protector, it makes sense rationally but emotionally, intuitively, doesn't impact me.

Finsihed Ep III and it's not as bad as I rememebered! the rpequels have been really immersive this time, I really enjoyed them.  yes, the script is pretty weak in many places in ep 3.  But the colour is great, of the scenes, (abn) when you think of the harry potter movies, all black/grey 2010s thing? But the helmet scene of vader's mask, really is well done.

Star wars ep 2 -- loved it more than usual. yes the love story and script stilted, doesn't make sense, but everything else i love and as an adult an im starting to get the politics and characters straighter, and it's rewarding tohave a world there was depth to explore, and i remember the scenes and battles more than LOTR battles (sorry) and def. more than the disney starwars. really wrewarding seeing Jango and Boba fett now that we're in the middle of the mandlolorian, seeing that origin is aweomse. some tender, dramatic, funny and beautiful moments made by the score.

I think Ep 1 star wars is great. world creation, action and diplomacy, a female leader that is aggressive, intelligent, and respectable, with nothing to prvoe. the art is amazing, directing and emotional tones build and fall.  IT's a fantastic adventure, gets better every time, don't know why ppl hate on it.

"Daddy" (Short Film) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcYzYiVDIlg&ab_channel=ChristianCoppola > unexpeted, daring, former disney star. he is standing in for his wife, but is more than a blank slate, the film refuses to give much, like an outburst, or something truly transforming due to the experience of the person, not the actor, that is hired to be his wife for a night.  And why hire a man.  Metaphor for acting, theatre in general, how we have actors stand in for people we love, or desires, phantom desires.

Justin Bieber - Holy ft. Chance The Rapper - YouTube
> i find this interesting for many reasons . pop trope of secularizing the religious, in this case, bieber has featured contemporary (well, from my childhood so at least 90s, protestant worship songs (evangelical) and in a kind of soft blasphemy softened with the mention of belief of god, calls the lover's embrace "holy" , in the same melodic refrain used in the song to mention god's holiness.  also referncing labour, fossil fuel extraction (bieber is an oil worker, getting laid off... try to keep it neutral like "times are tough" but seems very close like "the unfair carbon tax" and this senitmentaializing of the oil labourors, who are compensated extravantly, (you go to get rich, get material wealth, come bakc with extra cars) , intersting choice of a labourer to sentamentalize.

recent films/shows
Cool Runnings A cheery and extremely positve colourful film, there is something so refreshing and great about john candy et al. This movie is able to talk about race without getting too heavy, and it just lets the characters be.  Such a fun, simple and rich film, such a 90s film, too. Truish story.

The Usual Suspects ABN watched before, liked, Netflix.  A story about the ambiguity of stories.  Complex plot and didn't get all the details. I was truly surprised at the end of the twist, it is a violent thriller that whips you around, that dark type of ending. 

A Ghost Story (2017) [Na'ama filmmaker hosting movie nights] I really liked it although it's incredibly sad and depressing.  "haunting" is truly the word for this story about the legacy of art and history of a house, as a ghost drifts back and forth between time.  I did not appreciate the dead child or "maurading natives" trope but it was small.  The score was horrific and zimmer like, and the featured track was shiveringly beautiful.  Extremely well made. Wikipedia: filmmaker inspired by an argument with wife to move to texas. The one scene I really didn't like , intellectually (emotionally it was perfect) , was the ghost raises the milk and throws the dishes around the terrified spanish-speaking family.. the only time the ghost clearly demonstrats itself to the people, and so now this is a world where people see ghosts and aren't fainted/disbeleif , it messed with the suspension of disbelief and didn't fit and I wish it wasn't in the film.

https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-ghost-story-2017 > yes ! 

https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/14/15969746/a-ghost-story-director-david-lowery-interview-casey-affleck-rooney-mara > such a great interview, and gives me perspective on the technique 
"So pretty much anytime he¡¯s by himself in the movie, we shot at 33 frames per second. And then often when he¡¯s interacting with someone else, we would shoot the human as a separate plate. So we¡¯d have Rooney in 24 frames per second, and Casey at 33, and we¡¯d composite the two together in post, so you¡¯d have two people operating in two different speeds in the same frame." - the technique conveys the theme so well

Space Force (2020) sharp edgy with very now political humour, Malcovich and carel are super great, JM is so absorbing. Not as progressive as I thought it would be, carell is a convservative, pro-military but the character arc is he is hesitant to wage war on china on the moon, wheras JM has turned violent when his life work is threatened.  But the wife in prison (maddening they never tell why), carell's characters bawking at the lesbian relationship, the making fun and "owning" the AOC representing satire character with carell character's appearl to military strength courage valour, kind of disapointing, would like to ahve let the criticism go deeper, instead of the show simply applauding americana in the end, how much self-affirmation do they need. also, not showing potus was wise, that suspense trick of not showing the villain or famous person (the queen) face, b/c so much SNL satire it would cheapen it when you see it, it is more ominous and funny by not seeing trump, just having characters report his ridiculus statements and requests to the character.

Into the spiderverse (2018) groundbreaking, astonishing and visionary technological art on a politically powerful superhero movie, stylish and the spirit og genz with music hip hop, likeable characters, with plenty of stan lee easter eggs and subtle cultural references.  Hung on a tired avengers plot pacing and avengers "dream team" i find tiring, and the sam raimie spidermans that the movie cheerfully mocks in good taste, i find there was somthing missing as with all big budgets these days that the old sam raime had; the time spent paused in the world, where a timed predictable plot point isn't being punched on the clock, like toby maguire's peter missing mj's theatre performance, and us watch her stilted away in it, or conversationsin teh rugged apartment, that make me connect to it.  i will remember this film as a stylish, dazzling of visionary art and talent, but it is nothing emotional beyond the momentary feelings garned up in the story as you watch it--- and yes im old and my pacing is different, even when we were young, our pacing was different, and movies were slower, even the big budget --- big budget meant special effects and stars. Sam raime's peter was truly awkward, the realism of the apartment was truly sad, the life was strained, it was something touching about it. and dark and devlish was james franco's opulence and wealth in comparison.  But this .. truly a marvel, one of my highscoolers final art project was inspired by it.  I think in this film through their eyes, what the future must be like, saturated by infinite media at their fingertips, and try to think what it's like.

365 Days Netflix -- polish , a tommy-wiseau sense of a fifty shades, the soundtrack, acting, story is rushed, nonsensical, just bordering on porn show (no judgement).  The amount of emotions you're supposed to go thru, the fact that the hero is a mafia boss angry about human trafficking while tracking a human is so inane; I couldn't commit to the sex fantasy because the reference to human traficking is you know, not fun, and the bizarre soundtrack pop songs at every second, the terrible whiplash you get, nothing is seamless. We were laughing while skipping through, assaf and I.  Has a distinct Room/tommy wiseau feel of a polish film  trying to make an american knowkc off of something already deplored by film buffs/the bdsm community (fifty shades)... I hate that this is my intro to polish films.  One note: the actress is pheonomenal and beautiful, and decent actor, the guy Massimo is just a junky creep, omg. So terrible

Come Worry with us, doc on Silver Mount Zion.  Limited edition DVD. Not a genre I'm drawn to, but I found myself absolutely lost in this canada-grant (ironically, in the convo that the band didn't want to being a grant band, I get that this doc isn't them), felt like I was their friends, if I saw them playing I felt like rooting for them, that I "knew" them.  Their music is called "post-rock" by wikipedia, I recognize that badass fusion, that bohemian realness. I don't find them pretentious.  They care so much about their art.  That's what struck me the most, in all these questions about Jesica staying home wtih the baby, trying to get a new band together, all these questions are crticial because their art is so unquestionable to them, they beleive so much in their work, that is inspirational.  JEssica has a unqieu time to tour with a young kid, and in the honus feature convos, speaks more on how the tour gives her a taste of what it could be like if communities raised kids, multiple adults in kids live, gender equality.  She speaks not wiht grand theoretics but simplicity honesty, and clarity. Francis recommendations, we watched , The Quare, 20th Cent women, then this doc, all seemed progresssively a more "Real" statement on humanity, the struggle to live meaningfully.  This doc was a candid intimate look at this couple in a band touring the US/canada, trying to figure out what it means to stay alive economically, not compromise artistically, and have a kid, gender roles.  The bonus features conversations of friends and the baby singing things.  All the more engaging wiht shots of Montreal, and a culture and people and sensibility I miss. The questions the band mates and their friends bring up, esp. the women, esp Jessica, are so poignant and critical for me.  Tremenedously enjoyed this, wow.  Brought a hunger for Motnreal back to me.  Her art-- the shadowboxes with vintage toys-- are they the ones that were installed all over mile end in store fronts ?  The other convo's esp. of the men (neat the different tone of convo between just the women and the men, thoggh they're coving overlapping topics) how different (more corporate) and more imperative "branding" is to young new bands.  I thought about these things in relation to my own work, also aesthetics and music I listen to, and how basic/mainstream a lot of my cultural world is, and how it could be enriched by looking harder, digging deeper into rabbit holes, esp. Canadian artists.  The film itself moves effortlessly, telling the story, a friend sitting in with them, mind you, the camera makes people like this nervous, who aren't used their personal lives taped like instagram contemporaries life. Such a triumph to hear JEssica's calm worries about her future career, and see all the new projects she's since done. JM: We're starting to make a language where we're walking arm in arm .. paraphrased, talking about accepting , a bit, the role of her staying home so her bf Ephraim can go on the road for his projects.

> it's so interesting to me, like I made offshoots, other artists, to frame other visual art I was doing, musicians do that too.

The Queen's Gambit (2020) Netflix (about 4 days)
Thoroughly enjoyable! perhaps some of the story is contrived, simplistic and all the 60s props I wouldn't count on for PHD historical accuracy.  But the acting, set design, costuming is a visual delight.  I think much is owed, filmmaking, scoring, to Beatuiful Mind (2001). The truly impressive feat is making a film for both audiences: ones who don't play chess and those who do.

20th Centurey Women (2017) fancis dvd lend.  Both Abn and I really, really liked this movie.  It had us laughing.  The characters, discussions, and film itself elludes simplications, truisms, genre seemingly, a time onthe cusp of punk scene 80s, it's a story about modernity and generational clash.  The eirie 80s ambiance score and rainbow filter lulled you like  a drug while these charcters , phenomenal acting, plays out and try to understand eachother.  Incredible. The attitude of Dorthea towards her son, was so relatable, to so many I know, "boomers", yet you see the other side, too.  "Abbie doesn't *understand* it, she's just a part of it."

 The Square (2017) DVD fancis lent.
 - I liked that there wasn't 1 clear message, too obvious. Absurd and terrifying at times.  Annoyed on how open it was, for eg, not doing more effort to go back and tie plots together like, besides the aftermass of the ad, there was nothing about the square installation, nothing happened at the site.  When watching the scene of the performer jungle man in the gala, you watched a mob gradually find the urge to kill another person, almost reminded me of Kubrick 2001 Space Odyssey... the Square alien arrives, you watch the chimps gain the urge, ability to kill eachother, and this ominious square is undoing in the same way, though it is supposed to be inspiring benevelence.  From writing my MFA thesis to this film, definitely triggers, and makes me question for the millionth time are these institutions necessary or vapid and harmful. I guess i would have liked for things to be a little bit more connected in the film.  One idea about the convo between Christian and the american interviewer about sex... she's trying to make a statement about feminism, he turns it on her to say she was attracted to it, maybe another example of how artists go to the world, trying to make statements but it's dishonest or not the whole story.

 > i also did have that thought, no police? I agree that a film should followits own internal logic; it can be anything, but at least be consistent.
 
- there were other things: like Christian did not have a character arc, in that, he ept making mistakes but kept trying to make things right, from the beginning to end, there wasn't really an arc
- also, we never figure out the significance of him not wanting to throw out his condom, he doesn't want any more kids ?

 The Good Place - 4 seasons on Netflix.  Morgan grobin, and highschoolers in my art class recommended it . 
 The first season was very dull and simplistic, ABN and I felt, but when they got moving and plotting, with agency this picked up the show.  Still think it is a soft secularism and doesn't really address moral issues, breezes over CAUSES of decisions.  A fun comedy, though.

Chicago 7 - Wow, this really riles your leftist up.  You ask: are the issues today the same as 1968?  Sadly, yes, police brutality, black discrimination. 1/2 century later: it'd be nice to watch this film as indulgent, proud moment: look at how awful things were back then,but no.  The all-star cast was so watchable; the many sides were painted with subtlies, the complexities of situations.  Hard to believe this trial really happened.  Makes you feel guilty about not doing so much in your life right now.  The craft of court-room film is excellent, a snappy telling like The Big short, but a bit more sober than that, but a bit more sober and less stylistic than Blackkklansmen, less Tarantino.  The writing was slick, the way they edited scenes and separate dialgoues to interact with one another.  Seems like a really important film, definitely in the spirit of these current times.

Cold filter.  Watchable, and written superbly, as the story is rarely "told", more shown. Fun at 44:05 to try and decide where in TTC what station the subway's at, Assaf guessed Rosemont.  5/5

"Trump is now in a bind.  Either (a) he's a terrible businessman who hemorrhages money and thus owes no taxes, or (b) he's a deceitful very wealthy man who uses shady methods to shield his riches from taxation.
I'm sure Trump would pick choice (b) and claim that everything he did was legal.  No doubt Trump will say, "this just shows that I'm smart."  
I'm not buying it.  Our country's government requires money.  If very wealthy individuals don't pay their share, where is Federal money supposed to come from?"

Diegesis (Greek ¦Ä¦É?¦Ã¦Ç¦Ò¦É? "narration") and mimesis (Greek ¦Ì?¦Ì¦Ç¦Ò¦É? "imitation") have been contrasted since Plato's and Aristotle's times. Mimesis shows rather than tells, by means of action that is enacted. Diegesis is the telling of a story by a narrator. The narrator may speak as a particular character, or may be the invisible narrator, or even the all-knowing narrator who speaks from "outside" in the form of commenting on the action or the characters.

WHMIS Concordia Helth and safety training.  - common phenomenon in many fields: educaiton, whatever. You get wrapped up ni teaching the own beuracy and history of irrelevant information, but because you're designing learning the ystem, you confuse that with what is actually essential for the employee/student to know. eg. this whmis , last time i took it in 2017 and now, much to do with the beauracy of th different organiztions, the different systems and years they took over, when all this infromation has the dangerous effect of the employee losing other critical info (health and safety) because this info blended in.  in the case of shock panic ermgency, only the most critically learned material will be recalled
- I think of all these systems, contained in contacted org's , instituions, these manmade systems to manage chaos, like ER nursing First Aid, NLS, bronze medallion, WHMIS, etc to contain danger

Book of Eli - like Equilibrium in the highly styled artistic violence.  Gary oldman fantastic, denzil plays a typical cold, determined indfeatable discplined hero that is more comic book than nuanced.  Denzil's Christian parable I'm fine with, the world building is fantastic and the morals are not just Christianity Saves, but that the Bible can be wielded for evil or good, and materialism was the fall of people, even if not directly responsible. But the violence doesn't excite me and i think it's pandering and inconsistent to character... first fight scene, the elader is defensless and kills him anyway... why? blood lust? then this must be examined.  or to "save" the woman from this bad gang she participates in.

Someone sent this link to me as a playful joke.  But it's really nasueating when you keep reading, exploring the site and realize it's not a joke.  The comments gives me clues what church and culture this might be associated with (what books/pastors are they listening to?)  The interview of the "feminist wife" shows how radical the position really is, even the woman looking to submit to God and gender roles but not to her husband.  In my conservative area, many Christians do not identify with Feminism as they see it is about making women more powerful than men.  But here, is an example of clearly a feminist wanting to be equal, not serving her husband as "earthly lord."  Astounding there are Biblical fundamentalists with such trendy and updated sites.  Even more revolting, in the comment section you have a young man who's fiancee was hesitant at first to be spanked because of "prior abusive relationship" but "warmed up" to the idea at last.  For a secular mostly at home with a very open and supportive sexuality, this is hard for me, as my past keeps coming back, not as past marriage or relationship but parent's idea of godly punishing their kid.  I guess I haven't totally become at peace with this.  This is for sure a bizaar outlier of a site.
Trying to get a sense what church he's from "About Me" The pen name I write under is Larry Solomon.  The reason I do
 not use my real name is the same reason that Christ hid himself from Jews:" > perhaps antiSemetic.  Evangelical Protestantism in Canada, for example, fetishizes Jews/Judaism on the reverse, desiring all their culture and veiwing them as precious form of pre-Christian.  Refers to Charles Spurgeon - sounds familar but can't revall if my dad listens to him.  LOL He is divorced, thank god. Okay, that makes me feel a little better.   There are as many forms of Christianity as there are Christians, and I could be thankful I hadn't been raised in this particular denomination.  But that would have made it easier for me to outright leave it.  Instead the values of sexism in my family's religion are still insidiously quietly there
Now to see some top Google searches to find some discussion about the Blog. 
https://www.patheos.com/blogs/nolongerquivering/2019/10/sexual-pleasure-not-for-woman-biblical-gender-roles/
> very interesting, a snarky author who has been looking closely at the content.  Interesting side note of "internal ideologial differences" in a community: American.Canadian chirstians/mainstream (Christian-Judeo influenced) hate Muslims for having their women have head covering, but fundamentalist Christans (Christianity orig. in the middle-east) have to acknowledge there is explict writing in the New Testment advising women to have their head covered. Most in my Church circle would do the "culturally relevent at the time" argument, but as we know, Bliblical fundamentalists always pick and choose what this argument applies to, and a deeply fundamentalist would have to eagerly support women wearing head coverings.
About NLQ blog : Iâ€™ve meet and been friends with a group of wonderful Christian women that oppose some of our most unBiblical female cultural enforcers. 
Patheos is a non-denominational, non-partisan online media company providing information and commentary from various religious and nonreligious perspectives. Wikipedia > ooh I didn't know this ! 
https://www.instagram.com/biblicalgenderroles/?hl=en > Oh very sad.  Links to Bliblicalnationalist, which is race relations so not surprised if this ideology is linked with Aryan White Supremacy.  Interesting how this Bliblcal Gender Roles does not even begin to hint at identifying as nonbinary, or even Gay, it seems to be blissfully unaware or not ready to tackle that fish, it's only "feminism" it's concerned with, and the most softest form of Feminism you've ever heard: a woman quietly resisting her getting spanked by her husband, or thinking him mad for doing so.  I actually wonder what fundamentalists like Ruth and Verne would have to say, because they're into this but Ruth is so powerful in the relationship, I'm always fascinated how people draw lines when they exist in a spectrum.  Nice, one of God allowing Covid to teach women to return from their selfish ways.  So not a pandemic denier.  Interesting, one image quotes 1 Timothy 5:13-14 , stating how Single Women get into more trouble than Married woman, which is a colour of the speech Ruth once sat me down in church and spilled, how her women's-only bible study become toxic place to bitch (or should I say, empathize, vent, connect out of desperation) about their husbands, and only when her husband came and they made it both genders bible study the men had a moderating influence, and this was not saying oh, it changed the social dynamic or something simply like that, but that it's connected to the Spiritual aspect of genders, and that is, that women left alone are dangerous, ie women are inherantly morally deficient in a way that men are not, and require men in their lives as a moderating influece.  I just can't get over the fact this guy has an instagram account.  I wonder if he browses teen blogs and shakes his head at their lustful feminism/independence but keeps looking every day.

The Notebook.  Wanted to watch for a long time, read a Nicolas Sparks so was ready to appreciate a sappy romance, a beloved specimin of the genre.  Wasn't expecting the immature simplicity of the story, left a lot for want.  Felt there were two unrelated stories, themes: rich/poor love conquers all, and dementia love conquers all, illustrated in the past story and present, and these stories don't relate to eachother.  Equally uncomforatable is the comfy silent Black present supporting and helping the white characters navigate poor and rich and help their lifestyles. It's heartfelt. But even the production didn't seem stellar: cheesy greenscreening of sunsets through windows and noticable studio lighting; this didn't help.  McAdams and Gosling are very watchable but their story is just so thin I could hardly believe it.
